description: Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Dwf.DwfXps.FixedPage.DTO.Geometry class. The geometry. Geometries are used to build visual representations of geometric shapes. The smallest atomic unit in a geometry is a segment. Segments can be lines or curves. One or more segments are combined into a path figure definition. A path figure is a single shape comprised of continuous segments. One or more path figures collectively define an entire path geometry. A path geometry MAY define the fill algorithm to be used on the component path figures

## Geometry class

The geometry. Geometries are used to build visual representations of geometric shapes. The smallest atomic unit in a geometry is a segment. Segments can be lines or curves. One or more segments are combined into a path figure definition. A path figure is a single shape comprised of continuous segments. One or more path figures collectively define an entire path geometry. A path geometry MAY define the fill algorithm to be used on the component path figures.

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PathGeometry](../../aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/geometry/pathgeometry/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the path geometry. A PathGeometry element constitutes a complete geometry definition. A PathGeometry element contains a set of path figures specified either with the Figures attribute or with a child PathFigure element. |
